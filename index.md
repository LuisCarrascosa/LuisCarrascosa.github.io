## Introduction
Airbnb is the worldâ€™s biggest accommodation-sharing site. Its rapid growth and impact on vacation rentals has generated heated discussions about its effect in several of the world's largest cities. So much that regulations have emerged against the free use of this website:

* Amsterdam: the rental of complete houses is limited to 60 days a year and this will be reduced by half
* Barcelona: short-term rentals must have a license and new licenses are not being issued
* Berlin: owners need a permission to rent 50% or more of their main residence for a short period of time
* London: short-term rentals of entire houses are restricted to 90 days a year
* Palma: the mayor has announced the ban on short-term rentals
* New York: It is usually illegal to rent apartments for 30 consecutive days or less, unless the host is present
* Paris: short-term rentals are limited to 120 days a year
* San Francisco: hosts must register as a company and obtain certificates for short-term rental. The rental of entire properties is limited to 90 days a year
* Singapore: the minimum period of public housing rental is six consecutive months
* Tokyo: home sharing was legalized only in 2017 and is limited to 180 days a year

Given the [Airbnb dataset of Madrid](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), we propose to obtain the following information:
## Objectives
The data will be processed to clean them and get as much information as possible. A statistical analysis will attempt to solve the following questions:
* Which areas have the most Airbnb properties, and which are the most expensive?
* Which amenities increase the price of an Airbnb listing?
* Influence of host features in the median price

## Processing the data

### Import the data
The dataset used for this project comes from Insideairbnb.com. The dataset was scraped on 2019-11-09 and contains information on all Madrid Airbnb listings that were live on the site on that date (20.539)

I will not import free text fields and I will remove the currency symbol from fields with amounts. "smart_location", "zipcode" are redundant having latitude and longitude. "reviews_per_month", "number_of_reviews_ltm" with "number_of_reviews" too. url fields does not add value to the model. I don't import "host_name", "host_location" and "host_about" too.

### Cleaning the features

I will drop columns with more than 85% nulls: ['host_acceptance_rate', 'square_feet', 'monthly_price', 'jurisdiction_names', 'weekly_price']

We only use latitude, longitude and neighbourhood_cleansed location. As we are studying Madrid, the city and country columns do not contribute anything

<div>
<style scoped="">
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>id</th>
      <th>latitude</th>
      <th>longitude</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>6369</th>
      <td>40.45628</td>
      <td>-3.67763</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>21853</th>
      <td>40.40341</td>
      <td>-3.74084</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>23001</th>
      <td>40.38695</td>
      <td>-3.69304</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>24805</th>
      <td>40.42202</td>
      <td>-3.70395</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>24836</th>
      <td>40.41995</td>
      <td>-3.69764</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

For the number of nights we will only leave "minimum_nights" and "maximum_nights". We will change the price column for the price per guest

<div>
<style scoped="">
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>id</th>
      <th>B_price_guests</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>6369</th>
      <td>35.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>21853</th>
      <td>17.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>23001</th>
      <td>60.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>24805</th>
      <td>40.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>24836</th>
      <td>28.75</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

We'll eliminate prices per guest above quantile 95. Thus we will eliminate possible artificially high prices due to the effect of smart pricing

![Image](images/outliers.png)

Thus we eliminate prices per guest that exceed 5000 and even reach 9000 dollars. Let's compare prices per guest in both dataset

![Image](images/price_dist.png)

We don't lose the two concentrations near the ids 20M and 35M. Now, let's represent each column to review them.

![Image](images/histograms.png)

Columns with only one category will be deleted: 
> ['has_availability', 'host_has_profile_pic', 'is_business_travel_ready' ,'require_guest_phone_verification', 'require_guest_profile_picture', 'requires_license']

### Categorical features
We review the categorical and datetime variables one by one
> ['experiences_offered', 'host_since', 'host_response_time', 'host_response_rate', 'host_is_superhost', 'host_identity_verified', 'neighbourhood_cleansed', 'market', 'property_type', 'room_type',
 'bed_type', 'amenities', 'calendar_updated', 'first_review', 'last_review', 'license', 'instant_bookable', 'cancellation_policy']

**experiences_offered:** we erase it because there is only one value

**host_since:** date that the host first joined Airbnb. We will calculate the difference of days and replace the nulls with the median

**host_response_time:** average amount of time the host takes to reply to messages. There is some possible values and nans. This nans we will impute these to a new value: unknown
> within an hour        11625<br>
unknown                3498<br>
within a few hours     2539<br>
within a day           1382<br>
a few days or more      408

**host_response_rate:** analogous case but for which we will group in a categorical variable: "unknown", [0-49%], [50-89%], [90-99%] y 100%
> 100%       10906<br>
90-99%      2310<br>
50-89%      2172<br>
0-49%        566<br>
unknown     3498

**host_is_superhost:** whether or not the host is a superhost, which is a mark of quality for the top-rated and most experienced hosts. There are only 12 nans. We will review the rest of columns "host_"

![Image](images/table2.png)

"host_is_superhost", "host_listings_count" and "host_identity_verified" has the same nulls. We drop these listings

**host_identity_verified:** whether or not the host has been verified with id. There are no nulls

> f: 13179<br>
t: 6261

**neighbourhood_cleansed:** There are no nulls

**market:** virtually there is only significant value. We eliminate it

> Madrid: 19406<br>
Other (International): 4<br>
Other (Domestic): 1

**property_type:** there are too much property types. We will group them into 3 categories: house, apartment and others.

>Apartment: 17909<br>
House: 1113<br>
Other: 418

**room_type:** we will group 'Hotel room' into 'Private room'

> Entire home/apt: 12078<br>
Private room: 7134<br>
Shared room: 228

**bed_type:** this feature is "Real Bed" in the 99% os dataset. We drop this column

**calendar_updated:** This feature does not add value to the model. Dropped

**license:** it's a license granted by the Community of Madrid. The majority (81%) is null. It's a free text column but we can group them in "t" (has license) and "f" for nans values

> f: 15778<br>
t: 3662<br>

**instant_bookable:** whether or not the property can be instant booked. It has no null values

> t: 11564<br>
f: 7876

**cancellation_policy:** whether or not the property can be instant booked. It has no null values but we need to regroup categories

> strict_14_with_grace_period: 7243<br>
flexible: 6152<br>
moderate: 6045

**first_review:** there are 15.9% of ads without review. We add a new column "B_time_since_first_review" that we will group in 5 categories:

> 0-6 months: 3652<br>
6-12 months: 2231<br>
1-2 years: 3667<br>
2+ years: 6804<br>
no reviews: 3086

**last_review:** we add a new column "B_time_since_last_review" that we will group in 5 categories:

> 0-2 weeks     5758<br>
2-8 weeks     5199<br>
2-6 months    2500<br>
6+ months     2897<br>
no reviews    3086

**amenities:** additional features in the property, e.g. whether it has a TV or parking. This data is a list and we need to **extract a list of all posibles amenities**
