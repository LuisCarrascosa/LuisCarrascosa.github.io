Analysing Airbnb data with pandas and plotly
Introduction
Airbnb is the worldâ€™s biggest accommodation-sharing site. Its rapid growth and impact on vacation rentals has generated heated discussions about its effect in several of the world's largest cities. So much that regulations have emerged against the free use of this website:

Amsterdam: the rental of complete houses is limited to 60 days a year and this will be reduced by half
Barcelona: short-term rentals must have a license and new licenses are not being issued
Berlin: owners need a permission to rent 50% or more of their main residence for a short period of time
London: short-term rentals of entire houses are restricted to 90 days a year
Palma: the mayor has announced the ban on short-term rentals
New York: It is usually illegal to rent apartments for 30 consecutive days or less, unless the host is present
Paris: short-term rentals are limited to 120 days a year
San Francisco: hosts must register as a company and obtain certificates for short-term rental. The rental of entire properties is limited to 90 days a year
Singapore: the minimum period of public housing rental is six consecutive months
Tokyo: home sharing was legalized only in 2017 and is limited to 180 days a year
